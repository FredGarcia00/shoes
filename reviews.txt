1.I was skeptical to try these but I must say I am very pleased! These will be my new go to instead of my flip flops! Order them, you will not be disappointed!!

2.Love these!!!! Cannot recommend them enough!! I am usually a size 7 in women’s US size, and the 7.5 fit me perfectly!! They are so comfortable & don’t slip because of the grips on the bottom. Love!!

3.Soft, comfortable, cute, very good quality slides. I was looking for them. Ordering another pair for my daughter.

4.I just got them. At first I was worried they wouldn't fit, because my feet tend to swell, but they fit very well. Now I'll have to get used to them, because they're different from the slippers I use to wear.

5.Was skeptical when I opened the package. But to my surprise they are VERY comfortable. I wear a size 8 1/2 shoe and the fit is fine. A little big, but the comfort is perfect. We have tile floors and these are the most comfortable slipper I have. Going to buy another pair for the pool. You can wash these in a mesh bag on gentle cold water cycle.

6.They look exactly like the picture, they also look cute on. They’re pretty sturdy and thick but that also means that they aren't as soft as advertised. The material is harder, not squishy like the video. I like them overall. I wish they had more support for the arch in my foot.

7.My foot size is a 7.5 and very wide. I bought the 7/8 and it fits great. My feet go easily inside and my foot stay secure, doesn’t slide or flop around. They are very comfy and thick. I like the material as they won’t get gross and will be easy to clean. 

8.Not hot or sweaty. Cool, easy and comfy! I've washed them in the sink and I've tossed them in the washer, THEN AIR DRIED. Perfect! I'm definitely ordering another pair, these say 38-39 on bottom, but in my regular size (7-8), maybe pink or yellow.
